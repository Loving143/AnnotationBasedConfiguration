Annotation Based Configuration :
Use Annotation-Based Configuration:
When you want to automatically detect components like services, repositories, or controllers without explicitly defining them in a configuration class.
For simpler configurations where you donâ€™t need complex logic to create beans.
Use Java-Based Configuration:
When you need full control over bean creation and lifecycle, such as configuring external resources (like a DataSource or TaskExecutor).
For modular, organized configuration where you want type-safe, refactorable code.
